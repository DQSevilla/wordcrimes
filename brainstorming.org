* Basic premise

  human is guesser,
  computer gives words, or multiple words,
  you have to guess them or you lose

** specify more:

   - how many mistakes are we allowed? 1? 3?
   - how many words does the computer give you
   - how many sets of words does the computer give you


   a b c | d e f g h i

   a + b + c - d - e - f - g - h - i -> vector

   vector |> findNClosest numberOfHints 

   (a b) + (c)


* algorithm

  this returns hints to the user

  #+BEGIN_SRC
  gen gameSize random words

  pick solutionSize random from them to be solutions
  all else are badWords

  cluster by vector the solutions into numberOfHints groups

  for each group
    add all vectors in group
    subtract sum of vectors in badWords
    
    |> findNClosest (numberOfHints / group.len)
  #+END_SRC
